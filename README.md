# NLP-243 Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing #

The course is taught by __Dr. Amita Misra__ , Adjunct Professor (NLP MS program) at __The University of California - Santa Cruz__.

The teaching assistant for the course is __Sicong Huang__ , III Ph.D student.

I have taken this course in the Fall Quarter-2024.

This course focuses on machine learning models and algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) including deep learning approaches. It comsists of applications and current use of these methods in industry. Topics include: an introduction to standard neural network learning methods such as feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks and encoder-decoder models with applications to natural language processing problems such as utterance classification and sequence tagging.
